#  Main procedure of Machine Learning
In order to choose the best fit algorithm for your problem you have to follow a very complex procude. This procedure however is not the end. But , it in only the begging of bigger problems about decision which algorithm to choose. It is an entry level to start learning the logic of Machine Learning.

###### Level: Beginner
